# What it does
This file uses the public api from collegefootballdata.com to gather betting line and final score data for college football games.  It then calculates the expected winning percentage based on the vegas consensus spread and compares that to actual winning percentages.

# Why
My Virginia Tech Hokies lost to fu#$%ng Liberty as 14.5 point favorites last weekend.  We've lost something like 5 times in 4 years as double digit favorites.  I want to know confirm that's nuts and our coach has to go and I'm not just reactin gpoorly to losing to the Fighting Evangelicals.
